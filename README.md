# ML-PACMAN: Gesture-Controlled Pac-Man

ML-PACMAN is an interactive, browser-based adaptation of the classic Pac-Man game that leverages hand gestures for control. A fine-tuned MobileNet model powers gesture recognition, enabling players to navigate the game without a traditional keyboard or controller. Additionally, a dashboard provides real-time insights into model performance and gameplay metrics. We have implemented various ways to visualize AI performance such as confidence score displays, real time interactions, UMAP, loss curve, etc. 

## âœ¨ Features
- **Custom Gesture Recognition**: Train a MobileNet model to recognize and map hand gestures to game controls.
- **Real-Time Interaction**: Use your webcam to control Pac-Man through intuitive hand movements.
- **Performance Metrics**: View loss rates, confidence scores, and other key model performance statistics.
- **Data Visualization**: Utilize UMAP to explore and analyze input datasets.
- **Classic Gameplay**: Enjoy Pac-Manâ€™s familiar mechanics with an innovative twist.
